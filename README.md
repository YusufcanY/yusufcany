Hi, I'm [Yusufcan YÄ±lmaz](https://yusufcanyilmaz.com) and I'm Frontend Developer. I'm currently working on Frontend Development and using Vue.js on the client-side and Nuxt.js on the server-side.

You can easily find my articles on Medium. I enjoy gaming and skating; those are two of my favorite pastimes. There is also going to social events and meeting new people. Outside of work, I'm now attempting to improve my English on Cambly.
